# Ryan A. Flynn's disclosures

Potential competing interests.

## Philosophy 

It's important to, when they exist, disclosing possible competing interests.

Categories below were found by Michael Hoffman via International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest. Potential conflicts remain for at least 36 months after the relevant relationships conclude.

As per Michael's idea, using a Git repository better enables exploration of since-removed conflicts and therefore fuller disclosure.
